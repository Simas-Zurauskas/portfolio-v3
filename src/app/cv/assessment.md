# CV Assessment

> Goal: Professional, confident, quickly eye-catching to employers.

## 1. What It Says (Content Analysis)

### Header & Title
- **Name**: Simas Žurauskas — clear, professional.
- **Title**: "Software Engineer — Full-Stack, Mobile & AI" — clean and senior. Reads like a real role, not a buzzword headline.

### Summary
- **Current**: Short, confident, and readable. It communicates scope (web/mobile/AI) + breadth (35+ projects, 10+ industries) + how you work (end-to-end ownership).
- **Strength**: Feels written by a person (no “passionate/hardworking” fluff).
- **Watch-out**: The phrase “10+ industries” can feel a little broad if asked; you already support it with examples (fintech/healthtech/cybersecurity/logistics), so keep those concrete.

### Experience (3 roles)
| Role | Duration | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| Radical Company (Full-Time) | Mar 2021 — Present (~4 yrs) | Primary role, good duration |
| FrontIT (Part-Time) | Apr 2025 — Present (~9 mo) | Very recent, light |
| Freelance | 2023 — Present | Overlaps with Radical, but framed clearly as parallel work |

- **Strength**: Bullets are now outcome/scoped (“Shipped 20+ web…”, “10 mobile…”, “AI features on 8 products”, team size 3–8).
- **Strength**: FrontIT reads specific and believable (HERE Maps, tachograph compliance, offline-first, background location).
- **Watch-out**: Some claims are still high-level (no user scale / performance / revenue). That’s not fatal for 1 page, but adding one more concrete metric to Radical would lift it.

### Skills
- **Strength**: Short list, easy to scan. Clear alignment with your experience (React/Next/TS, React Native/Expo, Node/GraphQL, AWS).
- **Watch-out**: One duplicate slipped in (`AWS` appears twice). Easy fix.
- **Watch-out**: “RAG” and “LangChain” are good signals; keep the list short like this—don’t expand into 30 tags.

### Education
- Only one entry: Turing College AI Engineering Certificate (2025).
- **Problem**: If there's a university degree, it's missing. If not, this section looks thin.

### Projects
- Now **5 projects** with variety across solo + teams, and roles (Tech Lead, Mobile Lead, AI Engineer).
- **Strength**: Good spread: EdTech, HealthTech, Social, FinTech, Construction B2B.
- **Strength**: Strive is “featured” and spans full width — reads as flagship work.
- **Watch-out**: None of the project entries include a clickable link. This is fine if the sidebar has a strong portfolio link (it does), but adding a link for Strive would improve conversion.

### Contact
- Location, email, phone, website, LinkedIn.
- **Issue**: GitHub is present in data, but currently **not rendered** in the UI. For many hiring loops, having it visible is an easy win.

## 2. What It Looks Like (Visual Analysis)

### Layout
- **2-column grid**: dark navy sidebar (280px), white main content (570px).
- Fixed print size: **850×1470** — tuned to fit current content as a single page.

### Colors
- Sidebar: `#0f172a` (dark slate) with `#ff6b35` (orange) accent.
- Main: white with dark text.
- **Feel**: Clean, modern, high-contrast. Orange adds energy without being loud.

### Typography
- Inter (embedded) with system fallbacks.
- Name: 2rem bold. Section titles: 0.65rem uppercase orange. Body: 0.78–0.85rem.
- **Feel**: Professional, readable, but not distinctive.

### Structure
- Sidebar: Contact → Skills → Languages → Education.
- Main: Header → Summary → Experience → Selected Work.
- **Feel**: Standard template structure. Nothing wrong, but nothing memorable.

### Visual Gaps
| Element | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Skills tags | Small and muted — don't "pop" |
| Experience bullets | All same weight — no hierarchy or highlight |
| Projects grid | Now reads well (featured + 2×2 below); no longer empty |
| No photo | Could add personality (optional, culture-dependent) |

## 3. How It Reads (Employer Eye-Scan Test)

Recruiters spend **6–10 seconds** on first pass. What do they see?

### First Glance (6 sec)
1. **Name**: Clear ✓
2. **Title**: Clear scope (full-stack, mobile, AI) without being cluttered ✓
3. **Sidebar skills**: Short list, readable ✓
4. **Experience timeline**: 4 years at one company — stability signal ✓

### Second Glance (30 sec)
1. **Summary**: Skimmable and human; reads fast ✓
2. **Bullets**: Credible numbers and scope ✓
3. **Projects**: Strong variety and role clarity ✓

### What's Missing for Quick Catch
- **No scale metric** (users, latency, cost, adoption) — even one would raise perceived seniority
- **No bold keywords** — everything is same visual weight
- **No single “signature” differentiator** beyond breadth — one short phrase could help (e.g., “end-to-end ownership in high-trust client work”)

## 4. How It Feels (Emotional Read)

| Positive | Negative |
|----------|----------|
| Clean, minimal, professional | Template-like, not distinctive |
| Organized structure | No personality or "spark" |
| Dark sidebar feels premium | Could be any dev's CV |
| Orange accent is confident | No standout achievement |

**Overall feel**: "Competent developer with solid experience" — but not "I need to interview this person."

---

## 5. Gap Summary (Priority Order)

### Critical (fix these first)
1. **Add one more concrete metric** — one credible number (scale, performance, cost, adoption) would meaningfully level this up.
2. **Render GitHub** — it’s already in data; displaying it is a simple trust signal.
3. **Clickable flagship link** — Strive or portfolio is enough; make it frictionless.

### Important (strengthen positioning)
4. **Keep skills tight** — current direction is good; avoid expanding into a long keyword dump.
5. **Make freelance “business value” clearer** — you’ve improved this; one more concrete example (timeline/impact) would help.
6. **Education** — if no degree, consider adding one more credible item (course/cert) or leave as-is but be ready to explain.

### Nice to Have (polish)
9. **Project link not clickable** — Make Strive URL a real link.
10. **Experience bullets have no hierarchy** — Bold the first 1–2 "top" achievements.
11. **Skills tags don't pop** — Consider subtle differentiation (primary vs secondary).
12. **No availability/timezone note** — Useful for remote roles.

## 6. Rewrite Suggestions

### Title (before)
> Full-Stack & AI Developer (Web & Mobile)

### Title (after options)
- "Full-Stack Engineer · AI & Mobile Specialist"
- "Senior Full-Stack Developer | AI, Web & Mobile"
- "AI-Focused Software Engineer (React · Node · LLMs)"

### Summary (before)
> Experienced Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer with 4+ years of professional experience delivering enterprise-grade and AI-powered applications...

### Summary (after)
> Full-Stack engineer with 4+ years shipping enterprise web, mobile, and AI products — from architecture to App Store. Built platforms serving 50K+ users across fintech, healthtech, and logistics. Now focused on integrating LLMs into production: RAG systems, AI agents, and intelligent automation.

*(Numbers are placeholders — use real metrics.)*

### Experience Bullet (before)
> Built scalable web applications with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

### Experience Bullet (after)
> Architected and shipped 8+ web applications (React, Next.js, TypeScript) serving enterprise clients in fintech, insurance, and logistics.

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Gather metrics** — Review past projects for user counts, performance improvements, client outcomes.
2. **Add 1–2 more projects** — Withinly, WiseMind, or other highlights from Radical work.
3. **Rewrite summary** — Hook + numbers + differentiator.
4. **Add GitHub** — Even if sparse, it shows transparency.
5. **Differentiate freelance** — Focus on solo ownership, client consulting, rapid delivery.
6. **Add React Native to skills** — It's a core competency.

## 8. Quick Wins (can do now)

- [ ] Remove duplicate skill (`AWS`)
- [ ] Render GitHub in contact
- [ ] Add a clickable link for Strive (or at least make portfolio link visually prominent)
- [ ] Consider bolding 1 standout phrase per role (optional, visual hierarchy)

## 9. Changes Made (2026-01-18)

### Title
- **Current**: "Software Engineer — Full-Stack, Mobile & AI"

- Tightened phrasing to read senior and believable.
- Standardized “cybersecurity” spelling.

### Skills
- Reduced generic terms (“Databases”, “LLM / AI”, “Agents”, “CI/CD”) in favor of specific-but-short items (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GitHub Actions, LangChain).

### Projects
- Featured layout: Strive spans two columns (flagship).
- Added 5-item grid with variety in roles and team context (Withinly, Circle of Trust, WiseMind AI, PP Platform).

### Contact
- Changed email to professional domain (hello@simaszurauskas.com)
- GitHub exists in data but is currently not rendered in the CV UI.

### Print / PDF

## 10. Still To Do

- [ ] Render GitHub link (or remove it from data if you don’t want it shown)
- [ ] Remove duplicate `AWS` in skills
- [ ] Add degree if you have one (education section is thin)
- [ ] Add one more concrete metric (scale/perf/cost/adoption) if you can verify it
